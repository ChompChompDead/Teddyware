before i start this, yes the client is hugely skidded from postman (though it isnt actually forked from it) <br>
hopefully everyone knows im a terrible coder and im still learning sooo yeah <br>
in the future, there will probably be a rewrite or a new client. not sure. <br>

#Credits
  These are the clients / people that helped to develop the client. <br>

 if you feel like you haven't been credited or I forgot you. <br>
 feel free to message me on discord Frostbyte#3340.
 
this project has been discontinued because of the lead developer being bored of the project.
the project might be revived again if me or the lead developer feel like doing so.

Thanks! for sticking to us in this crazy journey

Teddyware is a utility mod for minecraft anarchy servers for 1.12.2. <br>
It is like **optifine**, and should only be used on servers that allow it. <br>
Also huge thanks to srgantmoomoo for making moo base :) some of the base is made by it (because im trash skid) <br>
Once the whole client is actually out of pre release I will work on unskidding. <br>

## How to use for development environments
I really only know how to set this up for intellij, soooo yeah <br>
- Download and open project in intelliJ (when opening, click the build.gradle and then open) <br>
- The project will auto build itself, so wait for that <br>
- After it builds, you want to go to terminal and run the command `gradlew genIntellijRuns` or `genEclipseRuns` for eclipse <br>
- You are almost done! <br>
- If you are on eclipse, do `gradlew eclipse` after that. <br>
- Refresh the project by closing and opening it, now go to the run configs section :) <br>
- 
## Run configurations
- Go to Run > Edit Configurations, then click on the plus sign and click application. <br>
- Put the name to whatever you want, doesn't matter (i usually put it as runClient) <br>
- First go to modify options, then select add VM options (VM arguments for eclipse). <br>
- The main class should already be GradleStart, but if it isn't just type gradlestart in the box and it will show it. <br>
- Now in VM options, you want to put this in: `-Dforge.logging.console.level=debug -Dforge.logging.markers=SCAN,REGISTRIES,REGISTRYDUMP -Dfml.coreMods.load=com.chompchompdead.teddyhack.api.mixin.MixinLoader` <br>
- Finally, set the working directory to `TeddywareDirectory\run` (replace the teddywaredirectory with wherever the main file is) <br>
- You are done with everything, now just press run <br>
- If setupdecompworkspace is showing an error, just remove it.
- also i do not know how to change anything in eclipse so diy ez <br>
